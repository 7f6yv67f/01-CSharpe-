# Struct
A struct is a `value type` . When a struct is created, the variable to which the struct is  
assigned holds the struct's actual data. When the struct is assigned to a new variable, it is  
copied. The new variable and the original variable therefore contain two separate copies of  
the same data. Changes made to one copy do not affect the other copy.  
struct: defalut public
field and members: defalut private
